# Reds-Funkin-Mod-Loader
So, I made a mod loader for Friday Night Funkin

# HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
Unzip the zip folder and drop the files from the in the same folder/directory as Funkin.exe
I recommend that you create a shortcut of "Red's Funkin' Modloader.exe" to your desktop for easy access.

# Mod Makers
--------------
To make the mod work with this program, you are going to need to do some tricks.

	1. Get the mod setup where it works.
	2. (optional) delete the normal FnF files **excluding folders**
	3. Use the included mod packager in mods -> RM-Mod -> Tools
--------------
# Players
--------------
To load a mod drag the .rml file to 'FnF -> mods -> RM-Mod -> mods' while the application is open.

An example mod will be loacated in the release section.
